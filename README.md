# UFO

### Overview of the project 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana create a an interactive webpage that will allow visitors to find out about UFO sightings in North America. So we needed to create the webpage from JavaScript. Dana wants the webpage to be clean, friendly and with good design, so it is easy for visitors to navigate there. Dana showed us the layout of how she wanted the webpage, so we helped her to created it like that. 

### Results 
We created the webpage with the design Dana wanted, the most difficult part was to create the multiple filters so the visitors could filter the data to visualize a more concise information. We set multiple filters so the visitor can play with them:

We can see that without any filter, the webpage shows all the data of the datas:

When we start inputing information in the search bar, the data filters, and we can see it like this:

### Summary 
I have two recommendations for Dana: 
1. I would try to make the data be filtered by putting something similar to the actual value the key has.
2. For the date, I would deploy a calendar so we can put the actual date.
